1. Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
	This project was meant to cover and compare the performance of stock indexes over the course of a year, using VBA code.

3. Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
	1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
		The advantages include being able to run more efficient code, whereas a disadvantage would be that the essence of the source code could be lost through revisions. 
	2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
		They apply since it is a real dataset that we're working on after all, and so these things that were discussed have to be taken into consideration.
